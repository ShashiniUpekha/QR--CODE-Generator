# QR--CODE-Generator
# Introduction
Given a URL , encode it to a QR (Quick Response) Code (According to the given
algorithm) and print it on the Linux terminal. You will be given a sample program that would do
the same task. Your task is to replicate the functionality of the given program.
The output should print exactly at the same place and scale as the given sample
program.
Please note that all the algorithms which are given are made up algorithms, you cannot reverse
the QR to the string by the existing QR scanners.
Inputs:
# User inputs:
● You should get the URL as a user input through STDIN (this string should be greater
than 3 characters and less than 120 characters)
Command-line arguments:<\br>
● If a colour is given as an argument to the program with the ‘-c’ flag, the program should
be able to print the QR code using the given colour. If no argument is given use black
and white as default
